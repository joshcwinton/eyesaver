# EyeSaver
Arduino based timer that tells me to rest my eyes üòµ‚Äçüí´

## Problem
I created this because I've been spending much more time looking at digital devices, especially for work. I've come across apps on my phone that remind me to take breaks but I feel that these are often counterproductive for me because I try to avoid using my phone while I'm trying to focus,

## Solution
As a solution, I decided that an independent embedded system would give me a way to remind myself breaks without being distracted. In it's current form, the system starts a 20 minute work timer as soon as it starts up and then gives me a 5 minute break, then loops. Pressing the pushbutton skips the current session and goes straight to the next one.

## Components
